Networking is not some scary professional thing. Networking is the biz jargon for just making friends. The best way to  “network” with someone is to ask questions and chat as if you were trying to be their friend. 

People say to go to networking events because you get to:



* Build real world connections and expand your industry network
* Impress the recruiters so much that they remember you and give you a job instantly
* Learn more about companies and allow them to wow you with their corporate jargon

And I always thought that was super waffly and that these never really actually helped me get a job. 

## Advice for Introverts

However, don’t fully rule out these events. Although some benefits seem too good to be true, because they are, there are some actual things you can take away. 

As an introvert myself, I used networking events to practice talking and get some much needed confidence. 

Thousands of people pass through networking events. You are highly unlikely to be ever remembered. Use this to your advantage. Go in, strike up a conversation, and if all goes wrong, who cares? No one will remember. 

Use this opportunity to go outside and touch some grass. Use networking events as practice getting out of your comfort zone and overcome the fear of talking to strangers. I used to be super shy, but through repetition I’ve slowly chipped down that barrier and am more comfortable with talking to strangers. Get confident asking meaningful questions (again by trial and error) and talking about yourself. That way, when you're in an interview (or date idk this applies too), you're prepped, ready and loose. 

It is always good to attend networking events and many unique opportunities have popped up for me just by attending (I was literally offered an internship after attending what was advertised as a “networking event”, which was really a group interview). 

Networking events are a Pascal’s Wager, the potential rewards are many, and the drawbacks are basically nonexistent. 

## Final Tips:



* If you really want to take your networking to the next level, try to do your research about the company and ask specific questions you actually want the answer to. 
* Be genuinely interested in them, and they will be genuinely interested to answer and genuinely interested to hear what you have to say.
