Extracurriculars are an excellent way to spend your time, and have its place on your resume. 

Even weekly social sports show you have time management, community and social skills. Also, it is fun. What else is there to say. 

## Industry Work

Internships, placements, uni projects all indicate to employers you have hard evidence, you can do the job you are applying for. These have the most transferable skills, which you can talk about in your interviews. 

Likewise, this work can help you see if this is the career you want to pursue. 

## Non-Industry Work

Yes, also good to have. Working at a normal job tells the employer many things. 



1. You can manage your time to fit work into your schedule
2. You have some interpersonal skills from communicating your team and manager
3. If you tutor of any kind, it shows you are smart and have the ability to present information in digestible ways. 
4. Hospo/retail, it shows you can interact with strangers and meet all sorts of weird demands. 
5. Money

## Societies

Yes, too. Aside from building a network of friends which you can lean on, society work develops your persona and skills in fun and meaningful ways. By being involved, you indirectly learn how to:



* Manage your time
* Work as a team
* Lead a team
* Adapt and problem solve on the fly
* Socialise (aka “networking”)

## Volunteering

Regular volunteering at charities of your choice also is a great way to show commitment and build those soft skills, just by being out in the real world and interacting with real people. 

Philanthropy is also highly looked up on, because helping people is good.
