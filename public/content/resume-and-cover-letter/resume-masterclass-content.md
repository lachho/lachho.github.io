Here I will detail what makes a good resume standard from the rest of the poule. If you haven’t made a resume yet, I recommend checking the resume crash course first. 

## Achievements Matter Most

Recruiters do not care one bit about titles. As we all know, and recruiters know, everyone in corporate is some sort of director or principal. Likewise, every student is some sort of director or VP of this or that. 

Given this, recruiters want to see WHAT IMPACT you made with this role, and this is what matters most. Dot points under any role MUST highlight how you made an IMPACT. 

It is not enough to simply write what you did in that role. Every dot point should not be able to be copied by anyone else - you did those specific things, and it is a unique achievement by you.

Dot points must be active and should be written in the form:

Action verb + Task + Quantifiable Outcome/Purpose 

Good:



* **Resolved** client and inter-department concerns, reducing risk backlog by **30%** at each stage. 
* **Automated** recruitment process using Excel macros to reduce manual processing by** 50%** and reduced recruitment timeline by **2 weeks. **

Poor:



* *Worked* with a team to design and market (reported) two concept designs for an electric bus depot.  
* *Assisted* water engineers working in the water planning, concept design, and treatment teams.  
* *Participated* in a 12-week program as a mentee to learn from engineers in the industry and refine my working skills.  

Notice in the poorer examples, the dot points show the bare minimum requirement of the work. The use of weak action verbs show a lack of initiative and impact, and doesn’t show off any transferable skills

As a caveat, not every line needs to be a quantifiable achievement driven dot point, but they are much stronger than other dot points. 

## An Interesting Reframe

A nice reframe is to think from the recruiter’s POV. This helps identify what’s important for the resume. A recruiter looks at a resume for an average of 15 seconds. In that time they are looking to see:


1. Can you do the job? Do you have the qualifications and experience? 
2. Will you commit to doing the job? What kind of personality does your resume exude?
3. Do you fit with the company’s culture? based off your background and experiences

If you don’t have your first internship, that is ok! You want to use the resume to build a profile about you to show that you are suitable for the job. You want to use your other experience to show you have recent, relevant achievements that reflect your suitability for the role. 




## Listing Skills

It is not enough to just list key skills at the bottom of your resume. You must have evidence. 

How? Active dot points under each experience. 

Instead of just writing leadership, prove it. 

Good example:



* **Elected** to lead a subcommittee of **63** to **organise** and **execute 24** events within a tight 1 year time frame **boosting** student attendance on previous years by **25%**.
* **Managed** conflicts and disagreements through **mediation strategies** to deliver a **$3000** surplus to meet the societies’ long-term goals

A poor example would be just listing skills:



* leadership
* communication
* team management
* conflict resolution
* time management
* finance management

Having said that, some people have a list of skills at the bottom to meet ATS requirements.
