## Finding Jobs

Many companies post graduate and intern job opportunities on their own company website. If there is a specific company you wish to apply for, be sure to check their career pages regularly. 

Many companies tend to post their opportunities on common sites such as:



* [GradConnection](https://au.gradconnection.com/) 
    * GradConnection targets specifically graduate and intern roles. 
* LinkedIn
    * Many companies post listings on their linkedIn. LinkedIn can also tailor their search results to match your profile
* [UNSWConnect](https://unswconnect.unsw.edu.au/) 
* Prospel
* Indeed


## Job searching resources:

Lots of forums are really helpful. You can find tips, insider-info and job offerings here. I recommend Whirlpool forums to find those in the same boat as you.
