Job applications for grad and intern can be a long process. 

Applications for graduates can open from February to May, for work to start February of the following year. This means you should be applying in your final year, not waiting until you finish courses to start applying. 

Internship applications are usually later in the year, applications openings ranging from June to early August. Internships are usually for the summer, from November to February. 

Each company has its own timeline, so be proactive in finding out when applications close. Companies usually do not accept late submissions. See the resources below to help you out. 

Each company also has its own recruitment timeline and process. The potential different stages are below. I’ve listed down every possible thing that could be asked + likelihood of seeing it out of 10. but often companies have 3-4 stages.

## Application Stages

1. Application Submission *(10/10)*. This can involve:
    1. Resume *(10/10)*
    2. Cover letter *(8/10)*
    3. Academic Transcript *(9/10)* 
    4. Online form asking for personal details, work experience and education details, basically all the stuff on your resume, but in a form. *(10/10)*. 
    5. Some companies may also have specific motivation or experience questions, usually 100ish words. *(5/10)*
    6. Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes at this stage filling out the questions, tailoring your resume and writing your cover letter. 
2. Online Assessment *(8/10)*. There are 3 main types
    7. Psychometric testing, usually in the form of games. *(7/10)*
    8. Technical assessments. This could be a case comp or coding assessment. For civil roles, *(4/10)*. 
    9. This stage is usually done in 1 sitting and averages around 30 minutes uninterrupted. 
3. Pre-screening Interview *(9/10)*. 
    10. Could be a phone call interview with HR regarding motivation to apply. About a 5-10 minute call. *(6/10)*
    11. One-way Interviews, usually motivational or behavioural questions. Ranges from about 1-5 questions, taking 20-30 minutes total *(8/10)*)*
4. Assessment Centres *(7/10)*. 
    12. These can be online or in person depending on the company. 
    13. Usually involves a group task, allowing companies to see how you perform in a group setting, while also screening multiple candidates at once. 
    14. Often, companies bundle group assessment centres with an 1 on 1 interview and networking.
    15. Expect these to take 2ish hours, or a half day if bundled with an interview.
5. Individual Interview *(10/10)*
    16. Every stage prior was to get to this last stage. 
    17. This is the decision stage, and is often with your future potential manager. 
    18. Takes about 1 hour. 


## Yipee, you got an offer!

After the interview, the hard parts were done. However, there are still more stages. These are chill though. 



1. Verbal Offer. 
    1. Call usually from HR, offering you the job. This is a conditional offer, given you pass the next stages. . 
    2. Here they will detail the salary, next steps and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
2. Reference Checks. 
    3. Standard. Usually 2 previous managers will have to fill out a short form. 
    4. Unless you were really terrible to your boss, you’ll usually pass this stage. (and if you were, don't pick them* as a reference)*
3. Background Checks
    5. Pretty standard as well. Police check, Academic check etc. Obviously, you don’t have a degree yet so don’t worry. 
    6. Working rights are also checked here. If you lied about your work rights, companies may not be able to sponsor you. 
4. Contract. 
    7. Yay. You are officially employed. Note that either party can easily break that contract with basically no repercussions. 
5. Relax. 
    8. Chill around, travel, finish your degree before you’re locked into the 9-5 forever. 

Obviously, getting from one stage to the next is the hard part, but the further you make it, the smaller the poule, increasing your chances of getting that offer.
