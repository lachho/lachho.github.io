There are three types of online assessments.

**Psychometric Testing**

These try to test your mental abilities and behavioural style. There are 3 main types of psychometric testing:

1. **Aptitude Tests.** These cognitive test are usually in the form of games, testing reaction time, pattern recognition, verbal, numerical & abstract reasoning, logic, EQ.
2. **Personality Questionnaires.** These are relatively straight forward and aim to explore personality traits such as risk adversity, leadership, teamwork, communication and behaviour. There are not necessarily “right” answers, and being too extreme can be your downfall (too aggressive on the leadership traits may portray you are headstrong and stubborn). These tests try to align your natural behaviours with the companies, so you can generally answer honestly for these. 
3. **Situational judgment tests.** These assessments present scenarios and you have to pick the best course of action. Again usually no right answer, often stuck between a rock and a hard place. They just want to see how you think

**Technical Assessments**

Usually more common for tech or consultancy roles. Tech roles may have an online coding assessment, in which you have X time to complete. Likewise consultancy companies often have a take home case comp, in which you have to type up a solution or bring your answers to the interview. 

**One way Interviews**

These are usually in the form of video recordings of yourself, answering pre-determined questions by the company. Think, typical interview questions. Usually you have 60s to think before it starts recording. 

Normal interview tips apply here. Use STAR where appropriate, speak confidently to the camera, and be succinct (waffling = bad). 

**General Tips:**

* Preparation is Key. Get some sleep, feel fresh and carve out some time dedicated to getting it done. 
* Practice! Get your repetitions in. 
    * UNSW has free practice resources. 
    * Likewise, submit apps for big companies such as EY, KPMG, Deloitte, PWC. They usually auto advance everyone to the online assessment stage for free practice. 
* Be mindful of time. Although some elements of the testing aren’t timed, the time you take also can tell the company a lot about you.
