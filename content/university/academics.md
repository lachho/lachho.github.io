## What is WAM?

WAM (weighted average mark) is just the average of all your courses. 

## Do you need a high WAM?

No. A high WAM (HD) can help you get an interview, but it's not the be all, end all. You still need the soft skills and lived experiences to power your interview. 

Having said that, a low WAM (&lt; 60) may impact your ability to get interviews and you may want to put some more time into pushing it up. 

So as long as you have a decent WAM, there is diminishing returns getting it even higher. Instead spend that time on extra-curriculars and soft skills. 

## What is WAM used for?

High WAM is not useless. Here are some many uses:


* Getting a job. High WAM stands out and shows you are a hard worker. 
* Scholarships. Academic scholarships look at your WAM. 
* Exchange. If you want to go on exchange, know that UNSW decides who gets to go where by WAM, that is highest WAM gets first pick, and then it moves down the line. This is not usually a problem, unless you are trying to go to a super popular school and there's lots of competition. 
* Awards. Dean’s list and honour roll if that's your goal. 
* Postgraduate study. Some postgraduate studies applications may look at your WAM or honours WAM. See below. 
* Research Thesis. For Research Thesis, a prerequisite WAM >70 is required. Higher Honours Research has a WAM requirement of > 80.
* Program/Degree Transfer. If you wish to change/drop degrees within UNSW or to another uni, there often is a minimum WAM requirement. 

## Honours WAM

Honours WAM goes on your piece of paper when you graduate. It is different from the WAM on your academic transcript. 

In Honours WAM, later year courses are more heavily weighted compared to first year courses. It’s not that important, but it determines if you graduate with first-class or second-class honours. 

The only use I think is if you are applying for postgraduate study.
