A resume is a marketing tool to convince employers to hire you. It’s a document that highlights all your top skills, experience and ways you can add value to the company. 

If you’ve never written a resume, below is what it should contain. For tips to make your resume even better, check out my resume masterclass pages. 


## Structure

Resumes have a few distinct sections. Each section (except the header) should be clearly labelled. Not every resume must have every section:



1. Header
2. Career Profile
3. Education
4. Work Experience
5. Extra-curricular Activities
6. Projects & Coursework
7. Skills
8. Awards & Achievements
9. Referees

The only mandatory sections I would suggest are Heading, Education and Work experience. You must try to balance quality here. Think if I added this section, does it make the whole resume stronger, or take away from my stronger sections?


## Header

This section should have:



* Full Name
* Email
* Phone Number
* LinkedIn (optional)
* Any Websites you own (optional)


## Career Profile

This is a concise summary of your skills, experience and professional qualities. 

Do not just write generic fluffy sentences that anyone can put there. 

Show off your top qualities. Make them unique to you. 

Aim for 3-5 dot points of evidenced based statements. 

Bad:

*I thrive in challenging situations where I can use problem-solving, and am eager to seek out opportunities to learn about the environmental engineering industry.*

This is buzz-word city. Anyone could have written this and you have no evidence this is true. 

Improved:

*Led cross-functional teams in numerous sustainability-based case competitions to deliver detailed presentations within tight deadlines.  *

This shows leadership, teamwork, time management and presentation skills. It doesn’t just tell us, it shows us through evidence of completing case competitions. 


## Education

As an university undergraduate, you should have this section. 

Include your degree (with majors and minors) and university, as well as expected graduation dates. 

Add any scholarships, awards and notable achievements. 

It is optional to include your high school. Add it if it is a well known school or you have any major achievements you wish to add. Things like ATAR, leadership roles and notable achievements  can be included here. I would say high school is a lower priority item. 


## Work Experience

Most, if not all prior work experience is worth adding to your resume. 

Include the company, job title and time period worked. 

Now to take it a step further and some information about what you did in that role. These should be:



* Dot Points, not full sentences. 
* In the first person implied tense. No pronouns. 
* Decent dot points will explain the day to day tasks
* Excellent dot points will show achievements and results
* Excellent dot points will also highlight the relevant skills developed from that role

Please check the masterclass page on how to nail your dot points. 


## Extra-curricular Activities

You can include whatever you want here. Things such as:



* Volunteering with charities
* Uni society involvement. 
* Regular clubs and sporting competitions
* Case Competitions

These should be formatted similar to the work experience above. 


## Projects & Coursework

In this section include any notable projects or coursework. They do not have to be academic related, although you may want to add coursework that was relevant to the role. Include:



* Personal Initiatives and projects
* Group projects from societies, class or even self initiated
* Case Competitions
* Relevant Coursework. 

Try to show relevance by explaining the skills developed by doing it, rather than what you actually did. 


## Skills

Often people have a skills section. You can include any hard technical skills, as well as soft interpersonal skills. This section has its uses, but is probably the weakest part of any resume. 

A skills section is purely a list of words, with no evidence that you possess any of these skills. A better way to demonstrate skills in a resume is through work experience, coursework and extra-curricular activities. 


## Awards & Achievements

This section is titular. Include any awards and achievements that you think are impressive and/or relevant. Awards and achievements don’t necessarily need to have their own section and can be integrated into the other sections. 

Awards and achievements show the recruiter you did more than just participate, you went above and beyond and was recognised for that. 


## Referees

Nowadays it is less common to require references on the resume. Often companies will contact you after a verbal offer regarding reference checks. You do not need this section but if you insist you can:



* Write their name, 
* Current role
* Relationship to you
* Contact details (email and phone)

Or, you can write “References available upon request”. 

Or just don’t have a references section if you need to make space.
