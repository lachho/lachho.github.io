## My Harsh Truth

Job hunting is hard. I was told to do so many things, network, write tailored cover letters, prep for interviews. Is any of the advice even effective?

I kept looking and looking for the single quick fix to get a job offer tomorrow.

The one phrase to memorise overnight. 

That one trick that works every time. 

But think about any elite athlete or world-class musician. Beethoven didn’t just play piano, he drilled hours upon hours until the symphony became his native language. Michael Phelps didn’t just swim laps, he perfected each stroke, each repetition, day in, day out. 

Your professional journey is no different. It’s all about volume.  

There is no magic formula that gets your resume noticed, no one-liner that gets you the job.

So how do you get good at writing cover letters, interviews, networking, running a business? 

Do the reps. 

Don’t expect to get an offer on the first try. Reframe your mindset, the goal is to get the reps in. 

Every cover letter you write is a rep. 

Every networking event you attend;

Every online assessment you complete;

Every stranger you talk to;

Every interview you speak at; 

Each completion a rep.

With every attempt you get a little smoother, a little more confident. Every failure isn’t a setback, it’s a data point. 

Learn. Adapt. Improve. 

The path to success is paved with practice. Complete so many reps that it would be unreasonable to fail. 

So my practical advice to you is: Just apply. 

Even if you don’t want to work there or think you're unqualified. Treat them as practice, get used to the flow, the curveballs, the hijinks. 

Outwork others. Outwork your self doubt.


## General Miscellaneous Tips



* **Say yes to every opportunity that comes your way.**
    * This includes applying for every job ever. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. 
* The more lived experiences you have, the more you have to talk about, in interviews, in resumes and in life. 
* Try different things. This can be travelling, trying new hobbies, taking a new route to uni. Be open to new ideas and adjust your worldview accordingly. 
* Be proactive. Start applying/drafting early so you have enough time to put in quality work.
* Trust your gut. It’s usually right
* Never get hit in the same place twice. Failure isn’t a setback, learn from your mistakes. 
* Acknowledge your mistakes early, and pivot accordingly.
