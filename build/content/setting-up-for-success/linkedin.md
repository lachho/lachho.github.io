In my opinion LinkedIn is overrated. This should be one of your last priorities, as everything else is way more important (resume, cover letter, interview skills, actual experience). If you are in a time crunch, leave this for last. 

Occasionally, professionals may want to connect with you. LinkedIn is the way to do so. Here are some tips for a good LinkedIn:


* Have a professional headshot. That means, inconspicuous background and wear a business shirt
* LinkedIn is like your resume but a web form. This means all tips for resume ALSO Apply.
* Keep it updated and relevant. Don’t put your entire life discography. 
* Descriptions should be what you achieved and how you did it (strong action verbs).
* Steer clear of buzzwords and word soup. Stick to succinct proven outcomes.
* Get a Custom URL. If you don’t know how, [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a542685/manage-your-public-profile-url?lang=en). 

Use LinkedIn to keep in contact with any professional relationships you may have built through networking events or any other means.
