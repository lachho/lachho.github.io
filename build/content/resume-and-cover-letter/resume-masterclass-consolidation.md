Hopefully, if you added every single experience in your life to your resume, you will have a resume that is a few pages long. All work experience is good. All volunteer experience is also good. Keep this master resume with all your experiences, achievements and skills saved for reference. This means you have lots of experiences in which you can draw on to show yourself off. 

But how do we know what's relevant to keep, and what to cut. 

Your resume should only have content relevant to the job description. Every experience should show off some relevant transferable skills, however, some experiences are more equal than others. Each experience can be judged by:



1. **Relevance**. A more similar experience has more transferable skills to the role you are applying for. Think internships, case comps, cadetships
2. **Time**. More recent experiences hold more weight and recruiters see them as more valuable. Primary school Captain? Impressive, but maybe a bit long ago. Try using a more recent leadership example. 
3. **Achievement**. Experiences where you went above and beyond are more impressive. Having quantifiable metrics or awards to show off your achievements in these experiences are much more powerful experiences. 

Use the above 3 criteria to determine which experiences to keep and which can go. 

Remember all experiences have some element of relevance, time and achievement. 

Someone who has a part time job must have time management. Maybe being really good at year 8 maths isn’t a required skill, but by adding tutoring experience to your resume, you show you have communication, teaching and patience. 

Good resumes are 1-2 pages. You don’t need to fill out the entire pages, less is more in this instance. You want to remove as much fluff as possible, such that recruiters are drawn to the most important stuff only. 


## Is this line really necessary?

As a final tip, if you are really stuck whether to keep or cut a line, imagine you had to pick one out of the two resumes, one with the line and one without. If the one with the line makes you definitively lean towards it, keep it in. Otherwise, if the added line doesn’t really make your resume more convincing, leave it out. 

For instance:



* Year 6 Captain, 2014 - Probably not going to pull anyone over the line since it was so long ago
* Barista and Store Opener, 2022 - Current - Maybe not engineering related, but without it, you risk not showing your time management skills, responsibleness and customer service skills.  


## Tailoring Resumes

Recruiters always say you must tailor your resume for EVERY individual job application. 

This means, adjusting key skills and phrases to match the job description you are applying for. 

I hated this advice. It was so out of touch. How can I tailor every single resume and still keep up with all my other commitments? 

Tailoring a resume isn’t bad advice, and you should probably do it. My tips to make it easier:



* Have a master resume, with all your experiences, all your action-oriented achievement based dot points and skills. This document could be 3-4 pages long
* Then easily tailor your resume for each job by copying the file, cutting and rearranging to have a concise tailored resume. 
* This is much easier than trying to think up relevant examples every time. If you think of a new line, add that to the master doc too.
