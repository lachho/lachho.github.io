## Applicant Tracking Systems

Many recruiters use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage the thousands of applications they receive. ATS use algorithms to read your resume and check compatibility with their job. Many many resumes are never seen by a human as they fail the ATS check. 

Tips to easily pass ATS:



* Include keywords from the job application. This could be skills, education or technical abilities. For instance, ATS may automatically eliminate resumes without a bachelors or leadership experience. 
* Avoid use of columns and tables. These can cause parsing issues in the ATS algorithm, causing it to mess up. I wouldn’t risk it. 
* Likewise with images and headshots. ATS can’t read images. 
* Have common headings that make it easy for ATS to find
* Save as a PDF rather than other file formats to ensure formatting doesn’t mess up and the file is read correctly. 
* Checkout [lachlanho.au/resume](http://lachlanho.au/resume) for a free resume screen with advice to fix it. 


## Formatting Tips



* Don’t include a headshot
* Write in the first-person-implied tense. This means no pronouns. 
* Use a 1 column format. Don’t use columns or tables. 
* Save as a PDF to ensure formatting across all screens and printers.
* Conduct a spelling and grammar check
* Get someone to read over and see if it makes sense. 
* Don’t add fluff to your resume. Recruiters can see through it and it reduces the quality of your resume. 
* Use a consistent font
* Keep font size consistent amongst headings and text. 
* Keep the email address you use professional.
* Order information in order of relevance to the position i.e. most relevant and recent jobs/education first. 
* 1-2 Pages is best. You do not have to fill up the entire page, especially if it’s fluff.
